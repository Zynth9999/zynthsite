Carrot cake. It's perfectly normal!
<br>
Time to make: 17-18 days. (if all goes well)
<ol>
<li>
Preheat oven to 350*F.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Mix yeast, sugar and milk together in a medium bowl.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Cream butter and sugars together until light and fluffy.
</li>
<br>
<li>
In another bowl, combine water, sugar, corn syrup and salt. Stir until a smooth buttercream is formed.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Add buttercream to dry ingredients and mix until just combined. Pour into a greased baking pan.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Bake for about 1 hour or until set. If the cake is still somewhat soft, remove and continue to bake.
</li>
<br>
<li>
To make carrot cake with fresh raspberries, bake at 350F for 10-11 minutes or until just slightly browned. It's time to die.
</li>
<br>
<li>
You should only boil or simmer cabbage while it's very young. But as you see, it's just being mended.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Don't keep this cooking water. Don't risk it!
</li>
<br>
<li>
When cabbage has reached the early autumn stage, you can still cook it. But be prepared for your flesh to be very tender and tasty.
</li>
<br>
<li>
We're keeping it raw, just a bit. But don't wait too long for a piece. You may need to give up for a while.
</li>
<br>
<li>
Serve with a side of smoked trout.
</li>
