<h2>Objective:</h2>
<h3>Find out if Jesus could be efficiently converted into a cup of coffee</h3>
<br>
<h2>Hypothesis:</h2>
<h3>A coffee made from Jesus would not be very good</h3>
<br>
<h2>Reason for this study:</h2>
<h3>It would be highly beneficial to society to have this knowledge</h3>
<br>
<h2>Definitions:</h2>
<h3>Google: The web search engine located at https://google.com
<br>Coffee: A brewed drink, as defined by ISO 3509:2005</h3>
<br>
<h2>Steps:</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Find the height of Jesus
<br>Step 2: Find the average mass of someone who is the same height of Jesus
<br>Step 3: Find the percentage by mass of the amount of water in an average human
<br>Step 4: Find how much mass a dehydrated Jesus would have
<br>Step 5: Find the average mass of a communion wafer
<br>Step 6: Find the amount of communion wafers contained in an average Jesus
<br>Step 7: Find how much blood Jesus had
<br>Step 8: Find the density of blood
<br>Step 9: Find the mass of all the blood contained in a Jesus
<br>Step 10: Find the density of wine
<br>Step 11: Find the ratio of blood to wine (if Jesus turned his own blood to wine)
<br>Step 12: Find the amount of wine that could be created out of 1 Jesus
<br>Step 13: Find the ratio of the mass of communion wafers extracted from Jesus to the amount of wine extracted from Jesus
<br>Step 14: Find the optimal amount of coffee grounds to water for making coffee
<br>Step 15: Find out if the resulting ratio is good for making coffee</h3>
<br>
<h2>Research:</h2>
<h3>1. According to Google, Jesus was about 1.65m tall
<br>2. The average weight of someone who is the same height of Jesus is around 63kg
<br>3. The average human is about 60% water by mass
<br>4. This means that a dehydrated Jesus would have a mass of around 25.2kg, which we can round to 25kg to simplify and account for previous rounding errors
<br>5. According to Google average communion wafer has a mass of around 0.25g
<br>6. 25kg divided by 0.25g equals 100,000, which would be the amount of communion wafers in the average Jesus
<br>7. The average person who is the same height of Jesus has around 4.5L of blood
<br>8. The density of blood is around 1.0565kg per liter
<br>9. This means that Jesus most likely had around 4.75425kg of blood (before being dehydrated)
<br>10. The density of wine is generally around 1.085kg per liter
<br>11. 1.0565kg/1.085kg (the density of blood divided by the density of wine) gives 0.97373271889, the ratio of blood to wine when converted if following conservation of mass
<br>12. The amount of wine created from a single Jesus would be the amount to begin with multiplied by the ratio of blood to wine, giving a result of 4.38179723501L, or 4.62936877878kg
<br>13. The ratio of communion wafers to wine would be 25kg:4.62936877878kg, which can be simplified to roughly 5.4kg:1kg
<br>14. According to Google, the recommended ratio of coffee grounds to water is about 1kg:17kg
<br>15. Comparing these ratios, it seems that there would be about 91.8 times the amount of needed coffee grounds (communion wafers) than there should be for the coffee</h3>
<br>
<h2>Results:</h2>
<h3>The coffee would be much too strong, and the constistancy would most likely be closer to that of soup than the desired drink.</h3>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<h3>A coffee made from Jesus would not work out very well, and would not at all be beneficial to society if it were created.</h3>
