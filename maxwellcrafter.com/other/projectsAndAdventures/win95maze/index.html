  Already existing project but new place to post about it: I'm recreating the Windows 95 maze screensaver, but in Unity so that it can be a VRChat world!
  I'll probably eventually attempt to recreate it in Batch (the scripting language) as well, but that will be a while â€” I first have to write a 3D rendering engine for it to use. Which is the main reason I want to make the screensaver in Batch, I need a 3D rendering engine that actually works unlike the others I've made in the past.
  I have the source code to go off of, and I've gotten a decent amount of it completed. I really just need to add random maze generation, the rotating things, and rats that work correctly. The rotating things will likely take longest because I'm not sure how I'll make them work without half the people who use them getting motion sickness from spinning unexpectedly.
  When I started I had most of the textures already, but about half were in a different format which I'd never heard of which was annoying.
  Microsoft seems to have made the format specifically for the maze screensaver and then never used it again. Which is understandable since bitmaps didn't support transparency, and gifs aren't really designed for graphics that I guess.
  Anyways, I tried to figure out the image format for a while and kind of gave up, so thank you to Foone for previously figuring it out and helping by providing the original images, along with other help.

  At first I thought the image format (.A8) was from another program, but it turns out to be completely different and just happens to use the same file extension.

  Here's the main textures for future use if anyone wants, though Discord may compress them and will most certainly change the data even if not visual:
